    this will be a calculator online, on this project i will use all the basic html css and javascript
that i have learned across this curriculum so far, which will include setting up a layout and style for the calculator  
creating the basic html layouts and position all the html elements on the web page accordingly after that 
i will work on the javascript to create the mat operations for each button and use the event capture on the DOM 
to listen for a click on the web page and execute the operations.
